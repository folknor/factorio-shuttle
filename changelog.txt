Version: 0.2.9
Date: 2024-11-23
  Changes:
    - Destination picker search now also works using the station number assigned by this mod,
      in the case where several stations have the same name. For example if two stations are
      called "Pickup: Copper", the buttons in the interface will list them as "Pickup
      Copper (1/2)" and "Pickup: Copper (2/2)". Searching now allows you to type for example
      "copper 2" to filter to the 2nd one.
    - Destination picker search now allows first-letter searching, so if you have a station
      called "North West Wall Defense", you can now type "nwwd" to filter to it.
    - Destination picker window can now be closed using Esc/E
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.8
Date: 2024-11-17
  Changes:
    - Fixed changelog so that it works in the games mod manager. Apparently two lines
      can't be identical. TIL!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.7
Date: 2024-11-17
  Changes:
    - Added a new button to the destination picker window that closes it
      until you enter a shuttle again.
    - Added another new button to the destination picker window that collapses
      or expands ("minimizes") the window depending on state. The window
      automatically expands again next time you enter a shuttle.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.6
Date: 2024-11-16
  Changes:
    - Potentially mitigate multiplayer desync

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.5
Date: 2024-11-15
  Changes:
    - Added minimap preview to station selection buttons in the destination picker.
    - As a result, the destination picker window is now at least twice as large.
    - Added new per-player runtime settings for whether or not the filter textbox
      (a) should recieve focus when the window opens
      (b) should clear itself automatically when you type a dot-to-go or hit Enter
    - Hitting Enter in the filter textbox now has the same effect as dot-to-go.
      (this was not possible when I initially ported this mod a long time ago,
      they must have added the possibility to react to Enter at some point the
      past 6-7 years :-P this is why dot-to-go exists at all, haha gg)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.4
Date: 2024-11-15
  Changes:
    - We now always try to path to the rail entity connected to the station instead of
      the station itself. This way we can path directly to any station even if it shares
      its name with lots of other stations.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.2
Date: 2024-11-14
  Changes:
    - First working release for factorio 2.0. Complete overhaul and simplified.
    - Shuttle Trains are now their own locomotives. Research them and build them like normal trains.
    - Removed top left button and added a green button to the standard button bar next to the quick slots.
    - Ctrl+J (default) and clicking this button has the same function.
    - Please read the mods readme/description to figure out how it works.
    - Shuttle Trains can now be called directly to a rail instead of the nearest station - just hover your mouse ("select") a rail just like when you want to mine/deconstruct it and click the button or use the keybinding.
    - Removed the vehicle grid stuff, removed the equipment stuff.
    - Added a setting per player to set the color of shuttle trains (default green). Shuttle trains do not inherit color from stations.
    - Mod should work on all worlds now, but I only tested it on nauvis thus far :-P
    - Reworked and simplified station selection interface.
    - Shuttles now play a delightful freely licensed non-attribution HONK sound when called.
    - Please note that it's still "impossible" (not really, I can hack around it but I've not done so yet) to send a shuttle to a specific selected station if more stations have the exact same name.
    - Lots of small changes that I can't remember.
