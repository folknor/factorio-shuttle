Version: 0.2.3
Date: 2024-11-15
  Changes:
    - We now always try to path to the rail entity connected to the station instead of
      the station itself. This way we can path directly to any station even if it shares
      its name with lots of other stations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.2
Date: 2024-11-14
  Changes:
    - First working release for factorio 2.0. Complete overhaul and simplified.
    - Shuttle Trains are now their own locomotives. Research them and build them like normal trains.
    - Removed top left button and added a green button to the standard button bar next to the quick slots.
    - Ctrl+J (default) and clicking this button has the same function.
    - Please read the mods readme/description to figure out how it works.
    - Shuttle Trains can now be called directly to a rail instead of the nearest station - just hover your mouse ("select") a rail just like when you want to mine/deconstruct it and click the button or use the keybinding.
    - Removed the vehicle grid stuff, removed the equipment stuff.
    - Added a setting per player to set the color of shuttle trains (default green). Shuttle trains do not inherit color from stations.
    - Mod should work on all worlds now, but I only tested it on nauvis thus far :-P
    - Reworked and simplified station selection interface.
    - Shuttles now play a delightful freely licensed non-attribution HONK sound when called.
    - Please note that it's still "impossible" (not really, I can hack around it but I've not done so yet) to send a shuttle to a specific selected station if more stations have the exact same name.
    - Lots of small changes that I can't remember.
